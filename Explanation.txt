Project Title: Customer Segmentation Analysis
Explanation:
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to segment them into distinct groups based on their age, annual income, and spending score. By using K-Means clustering, we identified different customer segments that share similar characteristics.

We performed the following steps:

-Data Loading and Preprocessing: We loaded the dataset and prepared it for analysis by handling missing values and encoding categorical data.

-Clustering: K-Means clustering was applied to group customers into segments. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method.

-Performance Evaluation: The Silhouette Score was calculated to measure the quality of the clusters, indicating how well-separated they are.

-Customer Profiles: Detailed profiles for each customer segment were created to summarize their key characteristics, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies effectively.

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, making it easier for businesses to target their marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction.
